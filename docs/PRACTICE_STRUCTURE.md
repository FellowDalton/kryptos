# Praylude - The Practice Structure

## 🙏 Core Scripture

**Matthew 6:6 (NKJV)**
> "But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."

**Goal**: Guide believers into the "secret place" - a state of deep, personal communion with God.

---

## 📖 The Six-Section Framework

Every Praylude meditation consists of six distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose in preparing the heart and mind for divine encounter.

---

### 1. **Welcome**

**Purpose**: Create an invitation to begin the journey

**Guidance**:
- Friendly, warm greeting
- Invitation to find a comfortable position
- Set the tone for sacred time with God
- Acknowledge the busy day left behind
- Create anticipation for what's to come

**Example Script**:
> "Welcome to this time set apart for you and God. Find a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down. Take a moment to settle in. This is your secret place, where the Father sees you and delights in your presence."

**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

**Techniques** (examples):
- Simple welcome
- Scripture-based welcome (reading Matthew 6:6)
- Breath-awareness welcome
- Gratitude welcome

---

### 2. **Mind**

**Purpose**: Quiet mental distractions through active imagination

**Core Practice**: Create a familiar sacred room in your mind, a consistent space you return to each day

**Guidance**:
- Visualize a sacred room (your "secret place")
- Place worries/concerns at the foot of the cross
- Use imagery to release distractions
- Establish mental stillness

**Example Script**:
> "In your mind's eye, see the door to your secret place. Open it and step inside. This is your familiar room, the space you return to each day. Notice the cross in the center. One by one, bring your worries and concerns to mind, and place them at the foot of the cross. Let them go, knowing God sees them and holds them."

**Duration**: 3-5 minutes (customizable)

**Techniques** (examples):
- Sacred room visualization
- Cross-centered release
- Mental decluttering
- Scriptural imagination (walking with Jesus)
- Breath-focused quieting

---

### 3. **Body**

**Purpose**: Release physical tension and create somatic stillness

**Core Practice**: Body scan or guided relaxation through active imagination

**Guidance**:
- Progressive relaxation (head to toe or toe to head)
- Visualize Holy Spirit as water or cloud enveloping the body
- Release physical tension
- Prepare the body as a temple for God's presence

**Example Script**:
> "Now bring your awareness to your body. Starting at the crown of your head, imagine the Holy Spirit like a gentle, warm cloud slowly descending. Feel your forehead relax, your jaw soften, your shoulders drop. The cloud moves down your arms, your chest, your belly. Release any tension you've been holding. Let the Holy Spirit envelope your entire body, bringing peace and rest."

**Duration**: 3-10 minutes (customizable)

**Techniques** (examples):
- Body scan (progressive relaxation)
- Holy Spirit as water (flowing over body)
- Holy Spirit as cloud (enveloping)
- Breath and body awareness
- Scriptural body meditation (body as temple)

---

### 4. **Spirit**

**Purpose**: Invite the Holy Spirit and establish spiritual focus

**Core Practice**: Active invitation to Holy Spirit, personal focus sentence/word

**Guidance**:
- Explicitly invite Holy Spirit's presence
- Create a short focus sentence (like a breath prayer)
- Establish receptivity to God's voice
- Align spirit with God's Spirit

**Example Script**:
> "Holy Spirit, we invite You into this place. Come, speak to us. Reveal the Father's heart. In a moment of silence, craft a simple sentence or word that helps your spirit stay focused on God. It might be 'Speak, Lord, I'm listening' or 'I rest in You' or simply 'Father.' Repeat this gently in your mind as we enter the meditation."

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Techniques** (examples):
- Simple Spirit invitation
- Breath prayer creation
- Listening prayer
- Scriptural focus (e.g., "Be still and know")
- Adoration and worship

---

### 5. **Meditation**

**Purpose**: The heart of the practice - deep communion with God through Scripture

**Core Practice**: Scripture-based meditation incorporating Jesus' teachings, honest dialogue with God

**Guidance**:
- Explore a biblical passage or teaching
- Ask God questions
- Listen for His response
- Be honest and vulnerable
- Explore different aspects of ourselves (wounds, joys, fears, hopes)
- See old stories in new light

**Example Script** (shortened):
> "Open your Bible to Psalm 46:10: 'Be still and know that I am God.' Let's meditate on this together. What does it mean to 'be still' in your life right now? What are the storms you're asking God to calm? Ask Him: 'Father, what do You want me to know about being still?' Listen... He may bring a memory, a word, a feeling. Receive it. Rest in His presence."

**Duration**: 5-20 minutes (varies, highly customizable)

**Content Types**:
- Jesus' teachings (I AM statements, parables, sermons)
- Old Testament stories (new perspective)
- Psalms meditation
- Character of God exploration
- Personal healing/growth themes
- Lectio Divina style

**Techniques** (examples):
- I AM meditations (John 6:35, 8:12, 10:11, etc.)
- Parable immersion
- Psalm contemplation
- Imaginative prayer (meeting Jesus in Scripture)
- Honest dialogue (expressing doubts/fears)
- Listening for God's voice

---

### 6. **Incorporate**

**Purpose**: Take the practice into daily life

**Core Practice**: Identify one thing to carry from the meditation into the day

**Guidance**:
- Reflect on what God spoke
- Choose a word, phrase, or insight to remember
- Later: practice carrying the "secret place" everywhere
- Build bridge between meditation and daily living

**Example Script**:
> "As we close, ask yourself: What is one thing I want to take with me today? Perhaps it's a word God spoke, a feeling of peace, or simply the reminder that He is with you. Hold it gently in your heart. As you return to your day, know that the secret place is not confined to this room - it's wherever you are with Him."

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Techniques** (examples):
- Simple reflection and commitment
- Word/phrase to remember
- Action step (specific way to live out what was learned)
- Carrying the presence (practicing God's presence throughout the day)
- Gratitude close

## 🎼 Musical Metaphor (Praylude)

Just as a musical prelude:
- **Sets the tone** → Welcome sets spiritual tone
- **Establishes the key** → Mind/Body establish inner harmony
- **Introduces themes** → Spirit invites divine themes
- **Builds anticipation** → Meditation is the crescendo
- **Influences what follows** → Incorporate bridges to daily life

Praylude is not the destination - it's the beautiful beginning that shapes everything that follows.

---

**The secret place is not a location. It's a state of being - fully present with the Father who sees and loves you.** 🙏
