# Kryptos the practice

The daily meditaion will consist of different sections that help the user to get into the secret place.

Some people might need to focus more on relaxing their body others on the mind.

## Welcome

This is just a friendly welcome and an invitation to find a comfortable position.

## Mind

This sections will introduce the concepts of active imagination, where you create your own familiar room, where you will return each day. Here you place your worries or concerns at the foot of the cross. Or use some other visualization to help you get rid of distractions.

## Body

This section focuses on relaxing the body. It could be a body scan that I guide you through in the beginning, but you eventually do by yourself or you just skip if you don't need it. I could also use active imagination in this section, where you imagine the Holy Spirit as water or a cloud that envelopes your body slowly.

## Spirit

In this section we invite Holy Spirit to come into the place and speak to us. I may ask you to make you own short sentence that helps your subconscious keeping right focus throughout the meditation much akin to breath work.

## Meditation

Now we are ready to tackle the daily or weekly meditation. This meditation will be based on scripture, incorporating the teachings of Jesus and old testament stories seen in a new light. We will explore differnt parts of ourselves, ask God questions and allowing ourselves to be honest with God and expect Him to be honest with us.

## Incorporate

Take something with you into your day. Further down the line we will start to take the secret place with us, and practice listening for the voice of God everywhere we are.
