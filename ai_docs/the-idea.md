# Christian Meditation: Entering the Secret Place

Our meditation practice is centered around the teachings of Matthew 6:6, NKJV: "But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."

The goal of this practice is to guide Christians into the 'secret place' - a state of deep, personal communion with God. This is not a physical location, but a spiritual state of being where we can feel God's presence, hear His voice, and experience His love in a profound, personal way.

Through this practice, we aim to:

1. Cultivate Intimacy with God: By entering the 'secret place', we seek to foster a deeper, more intimate relationship with our Heavenly Father. This is a space where we can be open, vulnerable, and completely ourselves, knowing that we are seen, loved, and accepted by God.

2. Focus on God: In the hustle and bustle of life, it's easy to lose focus on God. Our practice encourages Christians to set aside dedicated time to solely focus on God, His word, and His presence.

3. Experience Spiritual Growth: As we consistently enter the 'secret place', we believe that Christians will experience spiritual growth. They will gain a deeper understanding of God's character, His love for us, and His plans for our lives.

Join us as we embark on this journey of seeking God in the 'secret place'. Let's deepen our relationship with Him, focus our hearts on Him, and experience the spiritual growth and blessings that come from being in His presence.

Let us meditate on these Scriptures:

Psalm 1:2: "But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night."1

Joshua 1:8: "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success."21

Psalm 19:14: "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O Lord, my rock and my Redeemer."21

Psalm 104:34: "Let my meditation be pleasing to Him; As for me, I shall be glad in the Lord."1

Philippians 4:8: "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."21

Psalm 63:6: "When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches."21

Psalm 119:15: "I meditate on Your precepts and regard Your ways."
