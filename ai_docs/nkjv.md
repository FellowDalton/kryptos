# Christian Meditation: Entering the Secret Place

Let us consider the words of our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 6:6 (NKJV): "But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."

Our meditation practice is founded upon this divine instruction, guiding believers into the 'secret place' - a state of profound, personal communion with God. This is not a physical location, but rather a spiritual condition wherein we may experience the presence of the Almighty, hear His voice, and receive His love in a most intimate manner.

Through this practice, we seek to:

1. Cultivate Intimacy with God: By entering the 'secret place', we aim to foster a deeper, more intimate relationship with our Heavenly Father. Here, we may present ourselves openly and vulnerably, knowing that we are seen, loved, and accepted by God.

2. Focus on the Divine: In the midst of life's tumult, it is easy to lose sight of God. Our practice encourages the faithful to set aside dedicated time to focus solely on God, His Word, and His presence.

3. Experience Spiritual Growth: As we consistently enter the 'secret place', we believe that believers will experience spiritual growth. They shall gain a deeper understanding of God's character, His love for His children, and His plans for their lives.

We invite you to join us on this journey of seeking God in the 'secret place'. Let us deepen our relationship with Him, focus our hearts on His truth, and experience the spiritual growth and blessings that flow from being in His presence.

Let us meditate on these Scriptures:

"But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night." (Psalm 1:2, NKJV)

"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success." (Joshua 1:8, NKJV)

"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer." (Psalm 19:14, NKJV)

"May my meditation be sweet to Him; I will be glad in the Lord." (Psalm 104:34, NKJV)

"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things." (Philippians 4:8, NKJV)

"When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches." (Psalm 63:6, NKJV)

"I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways." (Psalm 119:15, NKJV)

May these words of Scripture guide our hearts and minds as we seek to draw near to God in the secret place.
