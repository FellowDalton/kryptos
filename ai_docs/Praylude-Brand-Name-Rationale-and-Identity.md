# Praylude: Where Prayer Sets the Tone

## Name Origins
Praylude is an elegant portmanteau combining "prayer" and "prelude," creating a meaningful connection between spiritual practice and musical terminology. This intentional blend suggests that prayer, like a musical prelude, serves as a beautiful beginning that shapes what follows.

## Musical Metaphor
Just as a prelude in music serves essential functions, Praylude draws parallel spiritual significance:

### Musical Prelude

- Establishes the key signature

- Bridges silence into symphony

### Spiritual Praylude

- Establishes inner harmony
- Introduces divine themes into daily life
- Creates sacred anticipation
- Prepares heart and mind
- Bridges earthly concerns to heavenly perspective

## Theological Resonance
The name aligns with biblical principles of preparation and sacred space:
- "Prepare the way of the Lord" (Isaiah 40:3)
- "Be still and know that I am God" (Psalm 46:10)
- Entering the "secret place" (Matthew 6:6)
