# Research Plan: Jesus's Teachings and I AM Consciousness

## Phase 1: Establishing Linguistic Foundation

1. **Key Terms Analysis**
   - Map all occurrences of ἐγώ εἰμι (ego eimi)
   - Document context and grammatical construction of each
   - Compare with Septuagint usage, especially Exodus 3:14
   - Create database of other consciousness-related Greek terms:
     - νοῦς (nous) - mind/consciousness
     - συνείδησις (syneidesis) - awareness
     - καρδία (kardia) - heart/inner being
     - ψυχή (psyche) - soul/life force

2. **Key Concept Review**
   - Kingdom (βασιλεία) usage and context
   - Father (πατήρ) references and relationship dynamics
   - Life (ζωή) vs biological life (βίος)
   - Truth (ἀλήθεια) - etymological investigation
   - Within/Inside (ἐντὸς) usage in broader Greek literature

## Phase 2: Systematic Teaching Review

1. **Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)**
   - Analyze each beatitude for consciousness implications
   - Study "light of the world" metaphor
   - Examine teachings on non-duality ("love your enemies")
   - Inner vs outer practice teachings

2. **Parables Analysis**
   - Kingdom parables
   - Growth metaphors
   - Hidden treasure/pearl metaphors
   - Categorical organization by theme

3. **Direct Teachings**
   - Private teachings to disciples
   - Public proclamations
   - Responses to questions
   - Prayers and intimate moments

4. **John's Gospel Deep Dive**
   - Chapter-by-chapter analysis
   - I AM statements in context
   - Unity teachings (John 14-17)
   - Light/darkness metaphors

## Phase 3: Contextual Integration

1. **Historical Context**
   - Jewish mystical traditions of the time
   - Greek philosophical influences
   - Early Christian interpretations
   - Desert Father/mystic interpretations

2. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   - Compare parallel accounts in different gospels
   - Note variations in Greek terms used
   - Examine context differences
   - Track thematic consistency

## Phase 4: Thematic Organization

1. **Core Themes to Track**
   - Present moment teachings
   - Unity/oneness statements
   - Identity teachings
   - Inner vs outer reality
   - Kingdom references
   - Light/awareness metaphors
   - Death/rebirth metaphors

2. **Potential Contradictions**
   - List passages that seem to contradict consciousness interpretation
   - Analyze original language
   - Consider alternative interpretations
   - Resolve or note genuine tensions

## Research Methodology with Claude

1. **For Each Session**
   - Focus on specific section/theme
   - Request Greek analysis of key terms
   - Examine multiple translations
   - Document insights and questions
   - Build on previous findings

2. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Create running document of findings
   - Note key insights for each passage
   - Track questions for further investigation
   - Build glossary of terms and interpretations

3. **Verification Process**
   - Cross-reference findings
   - Check linguistic claims
   - Compare with scholarly sources
   - Note areas of uncertainty

## Key Questions for Each Text

1. **Linguistic Analysis**
   - What are the key Greek terms?
   - How are they used elsewhere?
   - What range of meanings is possible?
   - How do different translations handle it?

2. **Consciousness Framework**
   - How does this align with I AM consciousness?
   - What metaphors for awareness are present?
   - How does it relate to other consciousness teachings?
   - What practical implications emerge?

3. **Integration Questions**
   - How does this connect to other teachings?
   - What light does it shed on difficult passages?
   - How does it fit the overall message?
   - What new questions does it raise?

## Note on Using Claude

- Start each session with clear focus area
- Provide specific passages for analysis
- Ask about Greek terms systematically
- Build on previous conversations
- Document findings consistently
- Use markdown artifacts for summaries
- Request specific comparisons when needed

This framework allows for systematic investigation while remaining flexible enough to follow promising lines of inquiry as they emerge.
