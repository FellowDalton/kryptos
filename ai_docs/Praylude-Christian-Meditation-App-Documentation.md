# Praylude: Your Daily Prayer Journey

## Vision Statement
Praylude is a Christian meditation app designed to guide believers into the 'secret place' - a state of deep, personal communion with God. Just as a musical prelude sets the tone for what follows, Praylude helps prepare your heart and mind for intimate connection with God.

## Core Concept
Our meditation practice is centered around Matthew 6:6 (NKJV): "But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."

## The Practice Structure

### Welcome
A gentle invitation to find a comfortable position and begin your prayer journey, setting the tone for your time with God.

### Mind
Using active imagination to create your personal sacred space. Like a prelude establishing the key of a piece, this section helps establish your spiritual focus.

### Body
A guided relaxation phase that, like the flowing notes of a prelude, helps prepare your physical being for divine encounter.

### Spirit
An invitation to the Holy Spirit, creating sacred anticipation for divine communion, much as a prelude builds anticipation for the main piece.

### Meditation
The core practice, based on Scripture, where the themes introduced in earlier sections develop into deep communion with God.

### Incorporate
Taking the harmony of your prayer time into your daily life, letting your praylude influence everything that follows.
