# Kryptos the app

So I want to define the kryptos meditation practice in a little more detail.

## Inspiration

I have tried other meditation apps in the past, like waking up with Sam Harris, and I really like using this app, but it also has it's limits. I like how you are tought to quite your mind and I use it to get into that state, but there is just so much more to meditation, when you start listening for the voice of God. And having that quite and secret place with God is just unlike any other meditation practice.

## A tool

I want the Kryptos meditation practice, to be a tool you can learn to use and ultmately you will not need the app anymore, because you will have mastered the practice and you will have your own private place with God.

## Ownership

Users of the app should be able to put together their own meditations, picking the techniques that fit for them, choosing how long each sections should be, they might evens skip some parts, if something comes easy to them. This is a way to give the user some feeling of ownership over their own practice.

The user will be able to create their own meditations, and they will be able to share their own meditations with others. One user can have multiple custom meditations consisting of different techniques already found in the app, but put together in a new way.

## Guidance

My job will be to guide people trough different meditation techniques to make it easier to get to the quite mind state. The standard daily meditation will consist of these different techniques chained together, and I will introduces I new part each week, or in an interval that makes sense.

I will introduce new meditation techniques, that brings something new to one of the sections found in the-practive.md file. The user will be able to find this new technique in the standard daily meditation, but the user can also choose to have this new technique pop up in their own custom meditation.

## Tech

There is going to be some technical requirements for recordings for the app. The sound files should be mixed on the fly and generated in the backend, so you are able to put sound bites together, taking some out, extending some, shortening others, all while having a cohesive sounding track.

It is important you can make this app your own. I will of course offer a standard practice, that you can follow as long as you want.
